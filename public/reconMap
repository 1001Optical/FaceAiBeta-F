export const frameRecommendations = {
  "Round Face": {
    recommendedFrames: ["rectangle", "square"],
    reason: "Round faces pair best with angular frames like rectangle or square shapes to add structure and balance to soft features."
  },
  "Oval Face": {
    recommendedFrames: ["pilot", "cateye"],
    reason: "Oval faces can pull off almost any style, but pilot and cateye frames enhance their natural symmetry beautifully."
  },
  "Square Face": {
    recommendedFrames: ["round", "pilot"],
    reason: "Square faces benefit from round or pilot frames to soften strong jawlines and add a touch of contrast."
  },
  "Heart-Shaped Face": {
    recommendedFrames: ["cateye", "round"],
    reason: "Heart-shaped faces look great in round and cateye frames, which balance a broader forehead and a narrow chin."
  },
  "Diamond Shaped Face": {
    recommendedFrames: ["pilot", "cateye"],
    reason: "Diamond faces shine in frames that highlight their cheekbones like pilot or upswept cateye styles."
